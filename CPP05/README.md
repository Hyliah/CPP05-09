<h2>♦ Objective / Description♦</h2>

The goal of this module is to introduce and practice **exception handling** and reinforce knowledge of **inheritance, abstract classes, and operator (`<<`) overloading**.  
The idea is to implement a bureaucracy simulation with **forms, bureaucrats, and interns**.

---

<h2>♦ Concepts Covered ♦</h2>

- Exception handling (`try/catch`)
- Dynamic allocation (`new` / `delete`)
- Operator overloading (`operator<<`)
- Function pointers and simple factory pattern
- Classes, inheritance, and abstract classes

<h2>♦ Exercises ♦</h2>

| Exercise | Name | Description |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| ex00 | Mommy, when I grow up, I want to be a bureaucrat! | Introduction to `try/catch` and exception handling |
| ex01 | Form up, maggots! | Creation of complex class hierarchy to manage forms |
| ex02 | No, you need form 28B, not 28C... | implement abstract `AForm` and concrete forms, with signing and execution logic |
| ex03 | At least this beats coffee-making | CImplementation of Intern using function pointer table to dynamically create forms |

<h2> ♦ Compilation & Execution ♦</h2>

All projects are compiled using a Makefile compling with flags :
 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98

All compilator gives tailored informations
exemple : 

```bash
make
./FormUp  ready to use.
./FormUp
```

<h2>♦ Ressorces ♦</h2>
Peer learning is a major part of the 42 experience.
Additional learning sources included:

- 42 Intra videos
- Official C++ documentation
- Discussions with peers

AI tools were used only to answer conceptual questions and help with debugging typos or logic issues,
not to generate the project code.
