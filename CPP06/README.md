<h2>♦ Objective / Description♦</h2>

This module focuses on **type casting in C++**, including:

- Scalar type conversions  
- Pointer serialization  
- Runtime type identification  

The goal is to understand **when and how to use each C++ cast safely**.


---

<h2>♦ Concepts Covered ♦</h2>

- `static_cast`  
- `reinterpret_cast`  
- `dynamic_cast`  
- Serialization / Deserialization  
- Polymorphism and RTTI
- Safe type conversion

---

<h2>♦ Exercises ♦</h2>

| Exercise | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| ex00 | Scalar Conversion | Convert between `char`, `int`, `float`, and `double` using `static_cast` |
| ex01 | Serialization | Convert pointers to integers and back using `reinterpret_cast` |
| ex02 | Type Identification | Identify the real type of an object using `dynamic_cast` |


---

<h2> ♦ Compilation & Execution ♦</h2>

All projects are compiled using a Makefile compling with flags :
 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98

All compilator gives tailored informations
exemple : 

```bash
make
./Convert  Enter a string to convert. 
./Convert a
```

<h2>♦ Personal Notes ♦</h2>

<h2>♦ Ressorces ♦</h2>
Peer learning is a major part of the 42 experience.
Additional learning sources included:

- 42 Intra videos
- Official C++ documentation
- Discussions with peers

AI tools were used only to answer conceptual questions and help with debugging typos or logic issues,
not to generate the project code.
